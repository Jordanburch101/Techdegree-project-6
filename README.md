## General info
This project demonstrates my use of JavaScript to choose a random phrase from an array, split the phrase into letters, and then puts those letters onto the game board.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.
